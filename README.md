#### Files:
`tally.py`: The main, the latest and the greatest file for tallying, has output's each transaction into separate row :)\
`tally_row_per_account.py`: Same file as above, but outputs each account's transactions into a single row.\
---
#### Installation:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

---
#### Usage:
Input files, `customer_details.xlsx`, `ledger.xlsx`, and `transactions.xlsx` are passed as input in the main function of the script (In the last part).

I've tried to make the script as modular as possible, so you can change mostly all stuff in the main function.

##### Run using:
```bash
python tally.py
```
